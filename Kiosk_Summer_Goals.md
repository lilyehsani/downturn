## Kiosk Frontend Summer Goals


Previously, the kiosk frontend team has worked to build a new kiosk UI using React and Bootstrap. All contributors (Angela, Tony, Lily) were new to React coming onto the project.
Currently, the team has a working MVP for almost all pages. Tony has worked with Django to integrate the backend with the current front end. There is now a functioning Django backend with a slide model and working slides/create_slide pages.
This summer of 2020, Tony and Lily will continue to work on the kiosk module.
The goals for this summer are as follows, in the following order:
- Finish the displays pages
  - Should be relatively straightforward as they are similar to the slides pages
- Implement slide previews
  - Will likely be more of a challenge as more slide type options were recently added
- Clean up frontend code
- Extend documentation
