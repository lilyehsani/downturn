# Downturn
Connect Four with a twist.  
Download everything, run "make".  
Run "./play -w \<width\> -h \<height\> -r \<run\> \<-m or -b\>".  
"run" is how many pieces in a row a play has to get to win.  
"-m" or "-b" indicates whether data is held in a matrix or bits. This has no effect on gameplay.  
Example: Normal Connect 4 would look like this: ```./play -w 7 -h 6 -r 4 -b```
